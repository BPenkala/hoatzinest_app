                    <p>HoatziNest is an online platform for enthusiasts that love
                        building for the web, whether it is a website, web application, or
                        mobile application, they can share ideas in teams. The teams
                        are self directed. Some are participating for fun and others have
                        commercialization interests.</p><br/>
                    <p>
                        We built it for the purpose of helping individuals to join and build teams for
                        development of websites or web applications. The idea is to allow users come to one place and give them new
                        experience with communicating in teams which results in higher
                        motivation levels and sparked inspiration for building amazing things
                        for the web. Technical and business mentoring resources can also be
                        found in this online platform.

                    <p>So to put it in perspective, this is simply a website for web designers 
                        and developers to share ideas and communicate. HoatziNest does not focus 
                        on the <i>&apos;get the job done&apos;</i> part of collaboration platforms or project management
                        systems, there are plenty of those online already. So the our mission
                        to make this site different is very simple; The go to website where
                        teams are born from inspirational ideas. Users will want to join other
                        members and build these teams with a solid relationship as the
                        foundation for them to work together and execute their common
                        plans on any other platform they desire whether it is through Github,
                        Google Drive, Asana, Teambox etc. These online Hoatzin techies will
                        be ready to make things happen with excitement and inspiration
                        under their belts.</p>
